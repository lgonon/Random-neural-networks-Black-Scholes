# Random Feature Neural Networks Learn Black-Scholes Type PDEs Without Curse of Dimensionality 
 This repository contains the main file to create the figures in  https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/21-0987.html

 The code can be used to learn the solution of PDEs from noisy data using a random neural network, see Section 5.4 in the paper.
